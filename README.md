## Personal Code of Conduct

These are some guidelines I attempt to follow when interacting with people on GitHub:

* Respect and Dignity: Treat all people with respect, regardless of identity, background, or belief.
* Good Faith: Assume others are engaging in good faith unless proven otherwise.
* Charitable Interpretation: When in doubt, interpret others’ words in the most reasonable and charitable way possible.
* Integrity: Speak truthfully, admit when I’m wrong, and avoid misleading or manipulative behavior.
* Empathy: Strive to understand the perspectives and emotions behind others’ words before responding.

It's my opinion that GitHub is better when people follow the principles above.
