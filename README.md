## 👋 Hello, I'm Ashley Connor

💻 Passionate software developer with a focus on **developer productivity, DevOps, software engineering,** and **release engineering**. Experienced in building scalable, user-friendly solutions and driving efficiency through automation and continuous improvement. I have a deep love for learning and contributing to open-source projects. Always looking for interesting challenges and collaborations!

🌍 While currently contributing from San Diego, California; I'm a strong advocate of flexible work environments and enjoy the freedom that remote work provides. Always open to discussing new projects, especially those that leverage global perspectives. Let's build something amazing together!

🔭 I’m currently working at HashiCorp on the Self Managed Release Engineering team, collaborating with both open-source and enterprise teams to ensure smooth delivery across various distribution channels used by our customers.

🌱 I'm diving into Rust, embedded development with Arduino ESP32, and mastering advanced Linux systems like systemd.
